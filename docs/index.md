First, let's understand how Adeus is built:

Adeus consists of 3 parts:

1. **A mobile / web app:**
   an interface that lets the user to interact with their assistant and data via chat.

2. **Hardware device (Currently Coral AI, but soon a Rasberry-Pi Zero W worth $15):** this will be the wearable that will record everything, and send it to the backend to be processed
3. **Supabase :** Our backend, and datavase, where we will process and store data, and interact with LLMs.
   Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative, a "backend-as-a-service" - which allows you to setup a Postgres database, Authentication, Edge Functions, Vector embeddings, and more - for free (at first) and at extreme ease!
   - [!!] But more importantly - **it is open source, and you can choose to deploy and manage your own Supabase instance** - which us crucial for our mission: A truly open-source, personal AI.
